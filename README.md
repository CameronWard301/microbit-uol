# Tutorial on BBC micro:bit at Informatics (UoL)

The [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) is a tiny programmable computer with a wide range of [hardware features](https://microbit.org/guide/features/) that we use to introduce prospective students to the joy of programming for the Cloud and for mobile platforms, including the Internet of Things.

## Tutorial

We are going to use the [Block language](https://makecode.microbit.org/blocks) and [Microsoft's MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#) for writing programs. Once the program is complete, you need to download it and flash it (transfer it to the micro:bit).

Below, we propose a small number of exercises to become familiarised with micro:bit.

### Flashing software to micro:bit

This is the process of transferring a program to a micro:bit. Let's get started with this [quick guide](https://microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/set-up/#drag-and-drop), where you will learn how to flash (upload your programs) onto your micro:bit. When following the link, "change the Choose your computer type:" to Linux.

:warning: Our machines run Linux (Ubuntu). To see the micro:bit folder, simply click files (Top left corner of your screen) and navigate to MICROBIT.

Lets start by flashing a simple program that displays a heart onto your micro:bit.
1. Navigate to: [micro:bit home page](https://makecode.microbit.org/#) and select the flashing heart tutorial.
2. Choose your preferred method to code the solution, blocks is the easiest but choose python/javascript for a harder challenge
3. Follow the steps in the tutorial
4. Once finished click the download button (bottom left of the window)
5. If prompted, save the .hex file the browser is trying to download to the downloads folder.
6. Time to flash the program to the micro:bit.
7. Open the downloads folder in one window
8. Open the micro:bit folder in another window
9. Simply drag (or copy the hex file to the micro:bit folder)
10. Once copied the micro:bit will restart and run the latest program you have just flashed to it.

**Optionally**, you may want to learn how to use your smartphone to flash a micro:bit program via bluetooth. If so keep reading and follow the steps below, else jump to the next section:
1. Install the app for your handheld device from [here](https://microbit.org/guide/mobile/).
2. Open the app and pair your micro:bit with your handheld device. Choose "pair" for android, for IOS select "choose micro:bit" from the homescreen and then choose "pair a new micro:bit"
3. Follow the instructions on screen to pair your micro:bit, if successful you will see a tick on the micro:bit
4. Navigate to the app homescreen and select `Create code`.
5. Once you have finished your program you can press the download button (bottom right of the screen) and follow the instructions on your mobile to flash the new program to your micro:bit

A more detailed tutorial on the use of this app, including videos describing how to pair a micro:bit can be found [here](https://microbit.org/guide/mobile/#og-app).

### Programming a micro:bit

Once you've practiced how to flash a program, let's get started with some small programs. We are proposing a list of exercises by order of complexity. If you don't have time to complete all of them during the session, keep exploring the resources at home!

For each of the exercises below, write the program using the `MakeCode` editor and flash it to your micro:bit:
1. [Display your name](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/name-tag): can you print `UoL` on the LED screen?
2. [Smiley buttons](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/smiley-buttons): learn how to interact with the micro:bit by using its buttons.
3. [Night night light](https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons/night-light/): learn how to modify the brightness of the LED screen. To start straightaway, click on [activity](https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons/night-light/activity) (don't forget to complete the challenges!).
4. [Dice](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/dice): combine maths with micro:bit's sensors in order to implement a dice.
5. [Coin flipper](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/coin-flipper): turn your micro:bit into a funny coin flipper.
6. [Rock-paper-scissors game](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/rock-paper-scissors): use the accelerometer to build the logic of this simple game, involving variables and choice making. 
7. [Temperature](https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons/temperature): turn the micro:bit into a thermometer. To start straightaway, click on [activity](https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons/temperature/activity).
