# Tutorial on BBC micro:bit at Informatics (UoL)

The [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) is a tiny programmable computer with a wide range of [hardware features](https://microbit.org/guide/features/) that we use to introduce prospective students to the joy of programming for the Cloud and for mobile platforms, including the Internet of Things.

## Tutorial

We are going to use the [Block language](https://makecode.microbit.org/blocks) and [Microsoft's MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#) for writing programs. Once the program is complete, you need to download it and flash it (transfer it to the microbit).

Below, we propose a small number of exercises to become familiarised with micro:bit.

### Flashing software to micro:bit

This is the process of transferring a program to a micro:bit. First, you need to have downloaded a program, say e.g. by using the `Download` button in the `MakeCode` editor. Second, follow one of the two approaches below for flashing the program to the micro:bit.

#### Flashing software using USB

This is a summary of the main steps involved:
1. Connect your micro:bit to the computer using the USB cable.
2. Using your file manager application of choice (`Window Explorer` in Windows), drag and drop the file containing your program to the micro:bit. 

A more detailed tutorial, including images can be found [here](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000013986-how-do-i-transfer-my-code-onto-the-micro-bit-via-usb).

#### Flashing software using Bluetooth from your smartphone/tablet

This is a summary of the main steps involved:
1. Install the app for your handheld device from [here](https://microbit.org/guide/mobile/).
2. Open the app and pair your micro:bit with your handheld device.
3. Access the `MakeCode` editor from the app.
4. Using your file manager application of choice (`Window Explorer` in Windows), drag and drop the file containing your program to the micro:bit. 

A more detailed tutorial, including videos describing how to pair a micro:bit can be found [here](https://microbit.org/guide/mobile/#og-app).

### Programming a micro:bit

Once you've practiced how to flash a program, let's get started with some small programs. For each of the exercises below, write the program using the `MakeCode` editor and flash it to your micro:bit:

1. [Flashing heart](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/flashing-heart): learning how to write your first program.
2. [Display your name](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/name-tag): can you print `UoL` on the LED screen?
3. [Smiley buttons](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/smiley-buttons): learn how to interact with the micro:bit by using its buttons.
4. [Dice](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/dice): combine maths with micro:bit's sensors in order to implement a dice.
